pre-intro, why did I choose this topic: learning about api's i took on board the idea that the more data you have , the cooler things you can create. Also all though my experience with web dev the structure of our apps is always responding to user events so the idea of automation is wicked cool.

intro - write last, to introduce the stuff you come up with

format of scraping is sending request to a website, Im using superagent to do that. Use a second tool to access the elements of the webpage, this is where the real scraping happens.

Cheerio - harrison scraping


osmosis super nice tool wowee, no large dependencies which is a bonus over cheerio and puppeteer.

scrapy python

I'd like to touch on a few scraping methods for the sake of filling things out and have examples of how they work.

I'd also like to talk about scraping. why its used, its origins and other weird stuff about it.

automation - testing - information gathering idk :)

Conclusion: scraping has a vigilante feel. Independent hackerman
